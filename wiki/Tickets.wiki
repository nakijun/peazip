PeaZip Issue tracker has moved to SourceForge in January 2014, and existing issues were imported in SourceForge Ticket system.

Please refer to the new [http://peazip.sourceforge.net/peazip-help.html software support] or [http://peazip.sourceforge.net/peazip-help-faq.html FAQ] page

Currently no way is provided from GoogleCode to set the old tracker offline or in read only mode, I apologize for the inconvenient.
